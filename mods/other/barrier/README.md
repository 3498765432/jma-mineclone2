# Barrier

Barrier mod for minetest

This mod adds 4 different types of barriers to the game. Each barrier in this mod can only
be broken or placed by those with the `barrier` priv. Each barrier also has no predicted node
breaking. Much like the iron doors in MTG. So it's impossible to clip through without cheats.

The following nodes are added.

## Barrier

Normal opaque barrier.

## Transparent Barrier

Barrier with a translucent texture.

## Invisible Barrier

Air-like solid barrier. Can be seen by those with the `barrier_see` priv.

## Liquid Barrier

Air-like passable non-pointable barrier that blocks liquid.

## Sky Barrier

Glowing barrier that imitates the default sky colour.
